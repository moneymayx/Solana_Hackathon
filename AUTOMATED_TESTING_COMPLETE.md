## ⏳ What Still Requires Manual Action (NOT TESTING!)

These are **deployment/setup actions**, not tests:

1. **Get Security Audit** - Hire auditor ($15k-$50k)
2. **Deploy to Mainnet** - When ready for production
3. **Initialize Staking Pool** - One-time setup
4. **Fund Production Wallets** - Add real USDC

**BUT - All these can be tested on devnet first!**
