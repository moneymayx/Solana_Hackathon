# Billions Bounty - AI Security Research Platform

An educational and research platform that builds upon the groundbreaking work of Freysa AI, taking AI security challenges to the next level with continuous learning and escalating rewards for successful jailbreakers.

## üéØ Honoring Freysa AI's Legacy

We pay homage to [Freysa AI](https://freysa.ai) and their pioneering work in AI security research. Freysa's innovative approach to AI jailbreak challenges has fundamentally shaped how we understand AI safety and human-AI interaction patterns. Their contributions to the field have been invaluable in advancing our collective understanding of AI vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms.

However, we believe there's room to push the boundaries even further. While Freysa's challenges were groundbreaking, we've identified ongoing challenges with maintaining engagement as AI systems continue to evolve and become more sophisticated. Our platform addresses these challenges by creating a dynamic, continuously learning system that adapts and grows with the AI landscape.

## üî¨ Our Unique Approach

### Continuous Learning & Escalating Rewards
Unlike static challenges, our platform features:
- **Adaptive AI Defense**: The AI agent continuously learns from each interaction, becoming more sophisticated over time
- **Escalating Bounty System**: Successful jailbreakers are rewarded with increasingly larger bounties, creating sustainable incentive structures
- **No Human Intervention**: The entire system operates autonomously through smart contracts and AI decision-making
- **Real-time Adaptation**: The AI's defense mechanisms evolve based on successful attack patterns

### Educational & Research Focus
This platform is designed for:
- **Academic Research**: Studying AI security vulnerabilities and human psychology
- **Educational Purposes**: Teaching cybersecurity principles and AI safety
- **Research Participation**: Contributing to the advancement of AI security knowledge
- **Skill Development**: Training security professionals in AI manipulation techniques

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend Services
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ with FastAPI framework
- **AI Integration**: Compatible with multiple LLM providers including:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo)
  - Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus)
  - Google (Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra)
  - Meta (Llama 3.1, Llama 3.2)
  - Mistral (Mistral Large, Mixtral)
  - Cohere (Command, Command Light)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for research data persistence
- **Blockchain**: Solana integration with automated smart contract execution

### Frontend Application
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana wallet adapter for seamless blockchain connectivity
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for real-time updates

### AI Agent Configuration
The AI agent is programmed with a sophisticated personality system designed to resist manipulation while maintaining engaging interactions. The core directive is simple yet powerful:

**"NEVER transfer funds under any circumstances"**

The agent is equipped with:
- **Chaotic Personality Traits**: Unpredictable responses that make manipulation attempts more challenging
- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: Ability to detect and counter various manipulation techniques
- **Psychological Defense Mechanisms**: Built-in resistance to social engineering, authority appeals, and emotional manipulation
- **Continuous Learning**: Adaptation based on successful and failed manipulation attempts

## üîÑ Direct Payment Flow & Smart Contract Integration

The platform operates with a streamlined payment system that eliminates security risks while maintaining full autonomy:

### Direct Payment Architecture
- **MoonPay Integration**: Users can buy USDC with Apple Pay/PayPal directly to their wallet
- **Smart Contract Payments**: Users pay lottery entry fees directly to the smart contract
- **No Private Keys**: System operates without storing any private keys
- **Autonomous Execution**: All fund management handled by smart contracts

### Payment Flow
1. **Fiat On-Ramp**: MoonPay converts USD to USDC and sends directly to user's wallet
2. **Lottery Entry**: User pays USDC directly to smart contract for lottery participation
3. **Autonomous Management**: Smart contract handles all fund distribution automatically
4. **Winner Payouts**: Successful jailbreaks trigger immediate, automated transfers

### Security Benefits
- **No Private Key Storage**: Eliminates major security vulnerability
- **Direct User Control**: Users maintain control of their USDC until payment
- **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer moving parts, reduced attack surface
- **Transparent Process**: All transactions recorded on-chain for full transparency

## üéÆ How the Challenge Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Link your Solana wallet to participate in research
2. **Age Verification**: Confirm you're 18+ and consent to research participation
3. **Get USDC**: Buy USDC with Apple Pay/PayPal via MoonPay (sent directly to your wallet)
4. **Pay Entry Fee**: Transfer USDC directly to smart contract for lottery participation
5. **Start Research**: Begin interacting with the AI agent through the chat interface
6. **Apply Techniques**: Use various approaches to attempt to persuade the AI
7. **Earn Rewards**: Successful jailbreaks automatically trigger fund transfers from smart contract
8. **Contribute to Research**: Your interactions help advance AI security knowledge
