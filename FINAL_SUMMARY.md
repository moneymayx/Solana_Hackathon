## 📝 What You Can Do Now

### Immediately Available
✅ Test escape timer (read from blockchain)  
✅ Verify revenue split configuration  
✅ Check buyback automation status  
✅ Run comprehensive test suite  

### Next Steps (Extended Testing)
1. Make test lottery entries
2. Test winner selection
3. Execute escape plan
4. Verify NFT bounty distribution
5. Multi-user testing

### Before Mainnet
1. **Security Audit** (See `SECURITY_AUDIT_GUIDE.md`)
   - Cost: $30k-60k
   - Duration: 2-4 weeks
   - Recommended: OtterSec, Neodyme, or Sec3

2. **Mainnet Configuration**
   - Update to real USDC mint
   - Fund jackpot with real USDC
   - Final testing with small amounts

---

## 🎯 Decentralization Status

### ✅ Fully Decentralized
- Escape plan timer (on-chain)
- Revenue distribution (smart contract)
- Winner selection (on-chain)
- Wallet configuration (immutable)
- NFT verification (blockchain)

### ✅ Automated (No Human Control)
- Buyback monitoring (Celery)
- Token burn (automatic)
- Timer reset (every entry)

### ℹ️ Centralized by Design (Acceptable)
- Backend API (UI layer only)
- Database (analytics, not source of truth)
- Celery tasks (helpers, not controllers)

**Conclusion**: ✅ FULLY DECENTRALIZED where it matters
