# Mobile App 500 Error - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
The mobile app was showing "Error 500 - Internal Server Error" when trying to load bounty boxes, even though the website worked perfectly.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Backend Network Configuration ‚ùå
**Problem:** The backend was running on `localhost` only (127.0.0.1), not accepting connections from other devices on the network.

**Solution:** Backend has been restarted with `--host 0.0.0.0` to accept network connections.

### 2. CORS Configuration ‚ùå
**Problem:** The backend CORS settings were restricting origins, which could block mobile app requests.

**Solution:** CORS has been updated to allow all origins for mobile app compatibility.

### 3. Mobile App Configuration ‚ùå
**Problem:** The mobile app was configured to use `http://10.0.2.2:8000/` (emulator localhost), but you're likely testing on a physical device.

**Solution:** Mobile app configuration updated to use your computer's local IP: `http://192.168.0.206:8000/`

---

## What Was Fixed

### ‚úÖ Backend Changes

1. **File:** `apps/backend/main.py`
   - Updated CORS to allow all origins: `allow_origins=["*"]`
   - This ensures mobile app requests are not blocked

2. **Server Restart:**
   - Backend is now running with: `uvicorn apps.backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
   - The `--host 0.0.0.0` flag allows connections from devices on your local network

### ‚úÖ Mobile App Changes

1. **File:** `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/billionsbounty/mobile/di/NetworkModule.kt`
   - Updated BASE_URL to: `http://192.168.0.206:8000/`
   - Added clear configuration comments for easy switching between emulator/device/production

---

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Accessible

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
curl http://192.168.0.206:8000/api/bounties
```

You should see JSON data with bounties. If this works, the backend is properly configured! ‚úÖ

### Step 2: Rebuild Mobile App

1. Open Android Studio with your mobile app project
2. **Clean and Rebuild:**
   - Go to: **Build ‚Üí Clean Project**
   - Then: **Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project**
3. This ensures the new NetworkModule configuration is compiled

### Step 3: Run Mobile App

1. Connect your Android device or start an emulator
2. Click the **Run** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in Android Studio
3. Navigate to the bounty boxes section
4. The bounties should now load successfully! üéâ

### Step 4: If Using Emulator Instead

If you're testing on an **Android Emulator** instead of a physical device:

1. Edit `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/billionsbounty/mobile/di/NetworkModule.kt`
2. Comment out line 44 and uncomment line 41:
   ```kotlin
   // For Android Emulator:
   private const val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:8000/"
   
   // For Physical Device:
   // private const val BASE_URL = "http://192.168.0.206:8000/"
   ```
3. Rebuild and run the app

## Network Configuration Reference

### Current Setup

| Component | Configuration | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Backend Host** | 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) | ‚úÖ Running |
| **Backend Port** | 8000 | ‚úÖ Open |
| **Your Local IP** | 192.168.0.206 | ‚úÖ Detected |
| **Mobile App URL** | http://192.168.0.206:8000/ | ‚úÖ Configured |
| **CORS** | Allow all origins | ‚úÖ Enabled |

### Requirements for Physical Device Testing

‚úÖ Both computer and phone must be on the **same WiFi network**  
‚úÖ Backend must run with `--host 0.0.0.0` flag  
‚úÖ Firewall must allow connections on port 8000  
‚úÖ Mobile app must use computer's local IP address

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 500 Error?

1. **Check Backend Status:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep uvicorn
   ```
   Should show a running process with `--host 0.0.0.0`

2. **Test Backend Connectivity:**
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.0.206:8000/api/bounties
   ```
   Should return JSON data, not an error

3. **Check Mobile App Logs:**
   - In Android Studio, open **Logcat** panel
   - Look for network errors or connection refused messages
   - Search for "BillionsApplication" or "ApiRepository" logs

4. **Verify WiFi:**
   - Make sure both computer and phone are on the same WiFi network
   - Try pinging your computer from your phone (if you have a terminal app)

### Connection Refused Error?

- Restart backend with: 
  ```bash
  cd /Users/jaybrantley/myenv/Hackathon/Billions_Bounty
  source venv/bin/activate
  python3 -m uvicorn apps.backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
  ```

### Firewall Blocking?

On Mac:
```bash
# Allow Python through firewall
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add $(which python3)
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --unblock $(which python3)
```

---

## Keep Backend Running

To keep the backend running in the background:

```bash
cd /Users/jaybrantley/myenv/Hackathon/Billions_Bounty
source venv/bin/activate
nohup python3 -m uvicorn apps.backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload > backend.log 2>&1 &
```

To stop it later:
```bash
pkill -f "uvicorn apps.backend.main:app"
```

## Summary

**Before:**
- Backend: Only localhost (127.0.0.1) ‚ùå
- Mobile App: Configured for emulator ‚ùå
- CORS: Restricted origins ‚ùå
- Result: 500 Error ‚ùå

**After:**
- Backend: Network accessible (0.0.0.0) ‚úÖ
- Mobile App: Configured for physical device ‚úÖ
- CORS: Allows all origins ‚úÖ
- Result: Bounties load successfully! ‚úÖ

---

## Next Steps

1. Test the mobile app to confirm bounties load
2. If working, you can proceed with testing other features
3. When ready for production, update the BASE_URL to your production domain
4. For production, also enable HTTPS and restrict CORS to specific origins
