# Final Build Fix - Dependency Configuration

## 🔍 Issue

The `.module()` error persisted even after removing the Solana SDK.

## ✅ Root Cause

The error was caused by how the Compose BOM was being configured within the dependencies block.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. Moved Compose BOM Declaration
- **Before**: `val composeBom` was declared inside the dependencies block
- **After**: `val composeBom` is declared at the top of the dependencies block
- **Reason**: Ensures proper initialization before use

### 2. Updated Kotlin Version
- **From**: `1.9.10`
- **To**: `1.9.20`
- **Reason**: Better compatibility with AGP 8.1+

### 3. Used Consistent BOM
- Both `implementation` and `androidTestImplementation` now reference the same `composeBom` variable
- This prevents version conflicts

## 📝 What Changed

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Jetpack Compose BOM
    val composeBom = platform("androidx.compose:compose-bom:2023.10.01")
    implementation(composeBom)
    
    // Core Android
    implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.12.0")
    // ... rest of dependencies
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Sync Gradle**
   - File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
   - OR click the elephant icon

2. **Build Project**
   - Build → Clean Project
   - Build → Rebuild Project

3. **Run the App**
   - Create emulator or connect device
   - Click play button

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome

The build should now succeed because:
- ✅ BOM is properly initialized
- ✅ No duplicate platform declarations
- ✅ Updated Kotlin version for better compatibility
- ✅ All Compose dependencies reference the same BOM

**The project should now build successfully!** 🎉
