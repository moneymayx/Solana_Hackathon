# Hilt Temporarily Removed

## 🔍 Problem

Hilt plugin not available in your Gradle setup/repositories.

## ✅ Solution

Temporarily removed Hilt to get the project building. We'll add it back later with proper setup.

### What was removed:
- Hilt plugin from build.gradle.kts
- Hilt plugin from app/build.gradle.kts
- Hilt dependencies
- Hilt annotation processor configuration

## 🚀 Try Now

1. **Sync Gradle**: File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
2. **Build**: Build → Rebuild Project

## 📝 Note

This means the app will compile but won't have dependency injection working properly. Once the build works, we'll add Hilt back with the correct configuration.

---

**The build should work now!** 🎉
