## Next Steps (Phase 4)

Remaining work to achieve full feature parity:

- [ ] Wallet connection UI
- [ ] USDC balance checking
- [ ] MoonPay web view integration
- [ ] Payment confirmation flow

### Additional Screens
- [ ] Dashboard Screen - Platform statistics
- [ ] Referral Screen - Code generation and tracking
- [ ] Staking Screen - Token staking interface
- [ ] Team Screen - Team management

### Smart Contract Integration
- [ ] Complete PDA derivation implementation

## Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Dependency Injection**: ViewModels need proper DI setup (currently using placeholders)
2. **API Repository Injection**: Need to wire up actual repository instances
3. **Base58 Encoding**: Placeholder implementation in WalletAdapter
4. **Solana SDK**: Using placeholder RPC client (needs actual implementation)
5. **Navigation**: Need to add missing screen routes (Dashboard, Referral, etc.)

## Testing Status

- ✅ UI Compiles without errors
- ⏳ Unit tests not yet written
- ⏳ Integration tests pending
- ⏳ End-to-end flow testing pending

## Build Status

The project should compile with minimal errors. Some dependencies may need adjustment based on actual Solana SDK availability.
