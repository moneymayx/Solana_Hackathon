# Next Steps - Android Studio is Opening! 🚀

Android Studio is now launching with your mobile app project. Here's what to expect:

---

## 📋 What Happens Next

### 1. **First Launch (Takes 5-10 minutes)**
   - Android Studio will open and ask you to "Import Gradle Project"
   - Click **"Trust Project"** when prompted
   - Wait for Gradle to sync (first time takes time)

### 2. **SDK Setup (If prompted)**
   - Android Studio may ask to download Android SDK
   - Click **"Next"** and accept the default settings
   - This downloads required tools (~500MB)

### 3. **Indexing (2-3 minutes)**
   - Android Studio will index all files
   - You'll see "Indexing..." in the status bar
   - Wait for it to complete before building

## ✅ Initial Setup Checklist

Once Android Studio is open and synced:

### Step 1: Verify Project Structure
You should see this structure in the left panel:

```
mobile-app/
├── app/
│   ├── src/main/
│   │   ├── java/com/billionsbounty/mobile/
│   │   └── res/
│   └── build.gradle.kts
├── build.gradle.kts
└── settings.gradle.kts
```

### Step 2: Configure Backend URL
Update the backend URL for API calls:

1. Navigate to: `app/src/main/java/com/billionsbounty/mobile/di/NetworkModule.kt`
2. Find this line: `private const val BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"`
3. Update to your backend URL:

```kotlin
// For Android Emulator (most common)
private const val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:8000"

// OR for physical device (use your computer's IP)
private const val BASE_URL = "http://192.168.1.XXX:8000"
```

To find your computer's IP:
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

### Step 3: Check for Errors
- Look for red error markers in the editor
- Check the **Build** tab at the bottom
- Common first-time errors:
  - JDK version issues
  - Missing SDK
  - Gradle sync issues

6. Click **"Next"** → **"Finish"**
7. Click ▶️ to start the emulator

### Option 2: Use Physical Device

1. Connect your Android device via USB
2. Enable **Developer Options** on your phone
3. Enable **USB Debugging**
4. Click **"Allow USB debugging"** on your phone
5. Android Studio should detect your device

### Run the App

1. Once a device is available, click the **Play button** ▶️ (top right)

## 📱 First Run Expectations

### What You'll See:
- ✅ HomeScreen with bounty grid
- ✅ Navigation to different screens
- ✅ Material Design 3 UI
- ⚠️ API errors (if backend not running)

### API Errors are Normal:
- If you haven't started your backend yet, you'll see connection errors
- This is expected! Just start your backend:
  ```bash
  cd /Users/jaybrantley/myenv/Hackathon/Billions_Bounty
  # Start your FastAPI backend on port 8000
  ```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Gradle sync failed"
- **Fix:** Go to **File** → **Invalidate Caches** → **Invalidate and Restart**
- Or try: **File** → **Sync Project with Gradle Files**

### "SDK not found"
- **Fix:** Go to **File** → **Project Structure** → **SDK Location**
- Android Studio will download the SDK

### "JDK not found"
- **Fix:** Download JDK 17 from https://adoptium.net/
- Install it and restart Android Studio

### "App crashes on launch"
- Check the **Logcat** tab for error messages
- Make sure BASE_URL is configured correctly
- Verify backend is running (if needed)

### "Cannot resolve symbol"
- Wait for indexing to complete (2-3 minutes)
- Try: **File** → **Invalidate Caches** → **Invalidate and Restart**
