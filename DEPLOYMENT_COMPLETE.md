## 🎯 Key Features Deployed

### 1. Fully On-Chain Escape Plan ✅
**How it works:**
- Every question resets `lottery.next_rollover` to 24h from now (on-chain)
- Smart contract stores `lottery.last_participant` automatically
- After 24h of no questions, anyone can trigger escape plan
- Contract distributes: 20% to last participant, 80% to community
- **Backend cannot manipulate timer** - fully trustless

**Verification:**
```bash
# Query timer from contract
curl http://localhost:8000/api/bounty/escape-plan/status

# Should show: "source": "on-chain (trustless)"
```

### 2. Automated Buyback Monitoring ✅
**How it works:**
- Celery beat task runs every 10 minutes
- Checks buyback wallet balance
- If balance >= $100 threshold:
  - Gets Jupiter swap quote (USDC → $100Bs)
  - Executes swap transaction
  - Burns tokens to incinerator
  - Records in database with `execution_type: "automatic"`
- **Zero manual intervention required**

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check celery logs
tail -f logs/celery.log

# Look for: "🔍 Checking buyback wallet balance..."
```

### 3. Revenue Split (60/20/10/10) ✅
- **60%** → Bounty pool (locked for winner)
- **20%** → Operational wallet
- **10%** → Buyback wallet (auto-burns at threshold)
- **10%** → Staking wallet (revenue-based rewards)

All splits happen **in smart contract** - backend cannot modify.

## 📊 System Status

| Component | Status | Decentralization | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Revenue Split** | ✅ Deployed | 100% On-Chain | Smart contract enforced |
| **Winner Payout** | ✅ Deployed | 100% On-Chain | Autonomous execution |
| **Escape Plan Timer** | ✅ Deployed | 100% On-Chain | Contract is source of truth |

## 🔧 Next Steps (Manual - See TODO List)

### Step 1: Initialize Lottery Contract ⏳
The contract is deployed but not initialized yet. You need to:

1. Create wallet addresses for:
   - Jackpot wallet (will be controlled by contract PDA)
   - Operational wallet (for operations)
   - Buyback wallet (for automatic burns)
   - Staking wallet (for rewards distribution)

2. Run initialization:
```bash
cd /Users/jaybrantley/myenv/Hackathon/Billions_Bounty
source venv/bin/activate

# Edit and run the initialization script
python3 scripts/initialize_lottery.py
```

**Configuration:**
- Research fund floor: 10,000 USDC (minimum jackpot)
- Research fee: 10 USDC (cost per question)
- Rates: 60/20/10/10 (already set in contract)

### Step 2: Start Backend & Celery Services ⏳

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend API
cd /Users/jaybrantley/myenv/Hackathon/Billions_Bounty
source venv/bin/activate
python3 apps/backend/main.py > logs/backend.log 2>&1 &

# Terminal 2: Celery Beat (scheduler)
celery -A src.celery_app beat --loglevel=info > logs/celery_beat.log 2>&1 &

# Terminal 3: Celery Worker (task executor)
celery -A src.celery_app worker --loglevel=info > logs/celery_worker.log 2>&1 &
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check all services running
ps aux | grep -E 'python3|celery'

# Check logs
tail -f logs/backend.log
tail -f logs/celery_beat.log
tail -f logs/celery_worker.log
```

### Step 3: Run Automated Tests ⏳

```bash
cd /Users/jaybrantley/myenv/Hackathon/Billions_Bounty
source venv/bin/activate

# Test 1: Module imports and logic
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
from src.smart_contract_service import smart_contract_service
print(f'✅ Lottery PDA: {smart_contract_service.lottery_pda}')
print(f'✅ Program ID: {smart_contract_service.program_id}')
"

# Test 2: Escape plan service reads from contract
python3 -c "
import asyncio, sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
from src.escape_plan_service import escape_plan_service
from src.database import AsyncSessionLocal

async def test():
    async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
        status = await escape_plan_service.get_timer_status(session, 1)
        print(f'Source: {status.get(\"source\")}')
        print(f'Can trigger: {status.get(\"can_trigger_escape_plan\")}')

asyncio.run(test())
"

# Test 3: Buyback monitoring configured
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
from src.celery_app import celery_app

schedule = celery_app.conf.beat_schedule
if 'monitor-buyback-wallet' in schedule:
    print('✅ Buyback monitoring: ENABLED')
    print(f'   Interval: {schedule[\"monitor-buyback-wallet\"][\"schedule\"]}s')
else:
    print('❌ Buyback monitoring: NOT CONFIGURED')
"
```

### Step 4: Manual Devnet Testing ⏳

Follow the comprehensive guide in `DEVNET_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`:

**Quick Tests** (15-30 minutes):
1. Ask a question → verify timer resets to 24h (from contract)
2. Fund buyback wallet with $100 USDC → wait 10min → verify auto-burn
3. Submit $10 entry → verify 60/20/10/10 split on Solana Explorer

**Full Test Suite** (2-4 hours):
- All 22 tests in DEVNET_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
- End-to-end user journey
- Failure testing (invalid calls, edge cases)
- Monitoring & observability

### Step 5: Professional Security Audit 🔐

Before mainnet deployment, get audited by:
- **OtterSec**: https://osec.io
- **Neodyme**: https://neodyme.io  
- **Trail of Bits**: https://trailofbits.com
- **Kudelski Security**: https://kudelskisecurity.com

**Cost**: ~$20,000-50,000  
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks  
**Critical**: Do NOT skip this step!

## 📈 Deployment Cost

**Total SOL Used**: ~2-3 SOL (devnet)
- Lottery contract deployment: ~1.5 SOL
- Staking contract deployment: ~1.2 SOL
- Transaction fees: ~0.05 SOL

**Mainnet Estimate**: ~$400-600 USD at current SOL prices
