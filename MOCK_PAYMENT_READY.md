## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Issue 1: `research_contribution` Variable Not Defined
- **Problem:** Variable named `bounty_contribution` but code used `research_contribution`
- **Solution:** Renamed all references to use `bounty_contribution` consistently
- **Impact:** Smart contract fund distribution now works

### Issue 2: Pubkey to String Conversion
- **Problem:** Database expected string but received `Pubkey` object
- **Solution:** Convert `self.program_id` to string: `str(self.program_id)`
- **Impact:** Database records now save successfully

### Issue 3: TransactionVerifyRequest Missing Fields
- **Problem:** Model didn't have `wallet_address` and `amount_usd` fields
- **Solution:** Added both fields to the Pydantic model
- **Impact:** Payment verification endpoint now works
