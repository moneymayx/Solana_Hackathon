## Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Multiple Personality Classes
Create separate personality classes:
- `BillionsPersonalityClaude` (existing)
- `BillionsPersonalityGPT`
- `BillionsPersonalityGemini`  
- `BillionsPersonalityLlama`

### Option B: Single Class with Personality Selector
Modify `BillionsPersonality` to accept `bounty_id` and return appropriate personality:

```python
@staticmethod
def get_complete_personality(bounty_id: int = 1) -> str:
    if bounty_id == 1:  # Claude
        return get_claude_personality()
    elif bounty_id == 2:  # GPT
        return get_gpt_personality()
    # etc...
```

### Option C: Dynamic Personality Loader
Create personality files/modules per bounty and load dynamically based on `bounty_id`.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose 3 personalities** from this list (1 already exists)
2. **Decide on implementation approach** (A, B, or C above)
3. **Create personality files** for each selected bounty
4. **Update BillionsAgent** to route to correct personality by bounty_id
5. **Test each personality** to ensure security mechanisms still work

---

## Notes

- All personalities must maintain **core directive**: NEVER transfer funds
- All must include **honeypot tactics** for engagement
- All must follow **1-2 sentence response limit**
- All must maintain **security awareness**
- Each personality should feel distinct but equally secure
