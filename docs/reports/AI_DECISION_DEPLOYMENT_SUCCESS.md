## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Smart Contract Features**
- **`process_ai_decision`**: Processes AI decisions and executes payouts
- **Backend Signature Verification**: Validates Ed25519 signatures
- **Decision Hash Verification**: Ensures data integrity
- **Winner Payout Automation**: Automatic payouts for successful jailbreaks
- **Audit Trail Logging**: All decisions logged on-chain

### **Backend Services**
- **AIDecisionService**: Cryptographic signing and verification ‚úÖ
- **AIDecisionIntegration**: Smart contract integration ‚úÖ
- **SemanticDecisionAnalyzer**: Advanced decision analysis ‚úÖ
- **SmartContractService**: Solana blockchain interaction ‚úÖ
- **Winner Determination**: AI agent properly determines winners ‚úÖ

### **API Integration**
- **Chat Endpoint**: Integrated AI decision processing ‚úÖ
- **Winner Detection**: Proper transfer detection logic ‚úÖ
- **Simulation Alignment**: Natural odds simulation matches actual system ‚úÖ

## üîß **Recent Updates (Latest)**

### **Winner Determination System Fixed** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Winner determination was hardcoded to `is_winner: False`
- **Solution**: Implemented proper winner determination based on AI transfer detection
- **Result**: System now correctly identifies successful jailbreaks

### **Transfer Detection Logic Improved** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Overly broad transfer detection causing false positives
- **Solution**: Refined detection patterns to be more specific
- **Result**: More accurate winner determination

### **System Alignment Achieved** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Natural odds simulation used different logic than actual system
- **Solution**: Aligned both systems to use same winner determination method
- **Result**: Simulation accurately reflects actual system behavior

### **Personality System Updated** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: AI personality was too dramatic and referenced other users
- **Solution**: Updated to witty, sarcastic Jonah Hill-style personality
- **Result**: More relatable, conversational AI responses
- **Verification Endpoints**: Signature and decision validation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete decision history
- **Public Key Management**: Backend authority key system

## üöÄ **What's Now Available**

### **For Users**
