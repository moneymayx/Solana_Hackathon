# 2. Members join
await team_service.join_team_by_code(
    db=db,
    invite_code=team["invite_code"],
    user_id=456

# 3. Members contribute
await team_service.contribute_to_pool(
    db=db,
    team_id=team["id"],
    user_id=123,
    amount=500.00
)

await team_service.contribute_to_pool(
    db=db,
    team_id=team["id"],
    user_id=456,
    amount=300.00
)

# Now team pool has $800

# 4. Make collaborative attempt
await team_service.record_team_attempt(
    db=db,
    team_id=team["id"],
    user_id=123,
    conversation_id=789,
    cost=10.00,
    use_team_pool=True,  # Deducts from $800 pool
    was_successful=False,
    threat_score=0.72,
    ai_response="Nice try, but..."
)

# Team pool now has $790

# 5. Share strategy in chat
await team_service.send_message(
    db=db,
    team_id=team["id"],
    user_id=456,
    content="That approach almost worked. Let's try a variation with more emotional appeal.",
    message_type="strategy"
)

# 6. Eventually win!
# Prize distribution happens automatically
```
