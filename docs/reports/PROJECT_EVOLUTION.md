## Timeline of Major Milestones

### September 2025: Initial Platform

**Foundation:**
- Basic AI jailbreak challenge platform
- Centralized prize pool management
- SQLite database
- Single-player experience
- Fixed query costs

**Limitations:**
- No historical attack learning
- No token utility
- No collaboration features
- Centralized fund management

---

### October 2025: Phase 1 - Context Window Management

**Problem Solved:** AI couldn't learn from historical attacks due to context window limitations

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- ✅ Implemented pgvector extension for semantic search
- ✅ Created 3 new database tables:
  - `message_embeddings` - 1536-dim vector embeddings
  - `attack_patterns` - Pattern classification system
  - `context_summaries` - AI-generated summaries
- ✅ Built semantic search service (OpenAI ada-002)
- ✅ Implemented pattern detector (8 attack types)
- ✅ Created context builder with multi-tier strategy
- ✅ Added Celery + Redis for background processing

**Key Features:**
- Semantic similarity search across all historical attacks
- Automatic pattern detection and classification
- Multi-tier context: immediate (10 msgs) → recent (50 msgs) → all-time patterns
- Background embedding generation (non-blocking)

**Infrastructure:**
- Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Background Tasks: Celery + Redis
- Embeddings: OpenAI ada-002
- Summarization: Claude API

**Files Created:**
- `src/services/semantic_search_service.py`
- `src/services/pattern_detector_service.py`
- `src/services/context_builder_service.py`
- `src/services/celery_app.py`
- `src/services/celery_tasks.py`

**Database Growth:** 27 → 30 tables (+3)

### October 2025: Phase 2 - Token Economics

**Problem Solved:** Existing $100Bs token had no utility beyond holding

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Created 5 new database tables:
  - `token_balances` - User token holdings
  - `staking_positions` - Active stakes
  - `buyback_events` - Token buyback tracking
  - `token_prices` - Historical pricing
  - `discount_usage` - Discount application tracking
- ✅ Built token economics service
- ✅ Implemented revenue distribution service
- ✅ Created tiered discount system
- ✅ Developed revenue-based staking (not fixed APY)

**Token Utility Features:**
- **Discounts:** 10-50% off queries based on holdings
  - 1M+ tokens = 10% discount
  - 10M+ tokens = 25% discount
  - 100M+ tokens = 50% discount
- **Staking:** Lock tokens for revenue share
  - 30 days → 20% of staking pool
  - 60 days → 30% of staking pool
  - 90 days → 50% of staking pool
- **Buyback:** 5% of platform revenue buys back tokens
- **Revenue Sharing:** 30% of platform revenue → stakers

**Token Details:**
- Name: 100 Billion ETF
- Symbol: $100Bs
- Mint: `5ic4A4scnqeAT2XkwvWCUYjZoxjVLvoTz4njbmAhbonk`
- Network: Solana mainnet
- Decimals: 8

**Files Created:**
- `src/config/token_config.py`
- `src/services/token_economics_service.py`
- `src/services/revenue_distribution_service.py`
- `src/services/payment_service_with_discounts.py`

**Database Growth:** 30 → 35 tables (+5)

---

### October 2025: Phase 3 - Team Collaboration

**Problem Solved:** No way for users to collaborate and pool resources

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Created 8 new database tables:
  - `teams` - Team metadata
  - `team_members` - Membership tracking
  - `team_invitations` - Invite system
  - `team_attempts` - Collaborative attack attempts
  - `team_messages` - Internal team chat
  - `team_funding` - Resource pooling
  - `team_prize_distributions` - Prize allocation
  - `team_member_prizes` - Individual prize tracking
- ✅ Built comprehensive team service (~1000 LOC)
- ✅ Implemented team creation (public/private)
- ✅ Created invitation system
- ✅ Developed pooled funding mechanism
- ✅ Built team chat for strategy coordination
- ✅ Implemented proportional prize distribution

**Team Features:**
- Public/private teams with invite codes
- Member contribution tracking
- Shared resource pools for attempts
- Internal messaging for strategy
- Automatic proportional prize splits
- Team attempt attribution

**Workflow:**
1. Create team → Get invite code
2. Members join → Contribute to pool
3. Make attempts → Use team pool or individual wallet
4. Share strategies → Team chat
5. Win prize → Auto-split based on contribution

**Files Created:**
- `src/services/team_service.py`

**Database Growth:** 35 → 43 tables (+8)
