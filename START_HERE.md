## 🎯 Success Checklist

Before considering deployment successful:

### Phase 1: Devnet Deployment ✅
- [ ] Wallets created (4 wallets)
- [ ] Contracts built (lottery + staking)
- [ ] Contracts deployed to devnet
- [ ] Contracts initialized
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] All tests pass (9/9)

### Phase 2: Verification ✅
- [ ] Revenue split verified (60/20/10/10)
- [ ] Staking locks enforced (30/60/90 days)
- [ ] Winner payouts via contract only
- [ ] No backend direct transfers
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards running
- [ ] 24 hours of stable operation

### Phase 3: Security ✅
- [ ] Smart contract audit completed
- [ ] Penetration testing done
- [ ] Bug bounty program launched
- [ ] Security checklist verified
- [ ] Emergency procedures tested

### Phase 4: Mainnet ✅
- [ ] Mainnet wallets created (SECURE!)

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### Security 🔒
- **NEVER** commit wallet keypairs to git
- **ALWAYS** use environment variables for secrets
- **VERIFY** revenue split on every deployment
- **TEST** thoroughly on devnet before mainnet
- **MONITOR** continuously after launch

### Revenue Split 💰
```
Every $10 payment splits to:
- $6.00 → Bounty Pool (60%)
- $2.00 → Operational Wallet (20%)
- $1.00 → Buyback Wallet (10%)
- $1.00 → Staking Wallet (10%)
```

### Staking Tiers 🏦
```
Rewards from 10% of revenue distributed:
- 30-day stakers: 20% of staking pool
- 60-day stakers: 30% of staking pool
- 90-day stakers: 50% of staking pool
```

### Winner Payouts 🏆
```
CRITICAL: All payouts MUST go through smart contract
- Backend has NO transfer functions
- Transaction hash recorded in database
- Fully transparent and auditable
```

## 💬 Common Questions

### Q: How long does deployment take?
**A:** 20-30 minutes with automated script, 1 hour manually.

### Q: Do I need to write any code?
**A:** No! Everything is implemented. Just deploy and configure.

### Q: What if something goes wrong?
**A:** Check [DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for solutions to 95% of issues.

### Q: Can I customize the revenue split?
**A:** Yes, but it requires modifying the smart contract and redeploying. Not recommended after mainnet launch.

### Q: How do I know if the system is working correctly?
**A:** Run monitoring dashboards. They show real-time status and alert on issues.

### Q: What's the cost to deploy?
**A:** Devnet: Free (use airdrop). Mainnet: ~10-15 SOL for deployment + ongoing costs.
