# MoonPay Integration Removal Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Reason:** MoonPay service application was denied

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of MoonPay integration (Apple Pay / PayPal payment option) from the Billions Bounty platform.

## Changes Made

### Website Frontend Changes
**File:** `frontend/src/components/PaymentFlow.tsx`

1. ✅ Removed `'fiat'` payment method type from state
2. ✅ Changed default payment method from `'fiat'` to `'wallet'`
3. ✅ Removed `PaymentQuote` interface (no longer needed)
4. ✅ Removed unused state variables:
   - `quote` (MoonPay quote data)
   - `paymentUrl` (MoonPay payment URL)
   - `pollingTxId`, `pollingIntervalRef`, `pollingAttemptsRef` (payment polling)
5. ✅ Removed unused imports: `useRef`, `ExternalLink`
6. ✅ Removed MoonPay-related functions:
   - `fetchQuote()` - fetched MoonPay quotes
   - `checkPaymentStatus()` - checked MoonPay transaction status
   - `startPolling()` - polled for payment completion
   - `stopPolling()` - stopped polling
7. ✅ Removed MoonPay payment creation logic in `createPayment()`
8. ✅ Removed "Apple Pay / PayPal" payment method button from UI
9. ✅ Removed MoonPay quote display section
10. ✅ Removed "Open Payment" external link button
11. ✅ Updated button text to only show "Pay with USDC Wallet"

### Website Backend Changes
**File:** `apps/backend/main.py`

1. ✅ Commented out MoonPay request models:
   - `MoonpayPaymentRequest`
   - `MoonpayWebhookRequest`
2. ✅ Commented out all MoonPay API endpoints:
   - `POST /api/moonpay/create-payment`
   - `GET /api/moonpay/quote`
   - `GET /api/moonpay/currencies`
   - `GET /api/moonpay/transaction/{transaction_id}`
   - `POST /api/moonpay/webhook`
3. ✅ Updated payment creation error message for fiat payments
4. ✅ Updated payment verification error message for fiat payments
5. ✅ Updated HTML template to remove "Apple Pay / PayPal" text

**File:** `src/payment_flow_service.py`

1. ✅ Added deprecation notice to file header explaining MoonPay removal

### Mobile App Changes (Android)
**File:** `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/billionsbounty/mobile/ui/screens/BountyDetailScreen.kt`

1. ✅ Commented out "Pay with Apple Pay / PayPal" button in payment flow UI

**File:** `mobile-app/app/build.gradle.kts`

1. ✅ Updated WebView dependency comment to reflect MoonPay removal

**File:** `mobile-app/FINAL_STATUS.md`

1. ✅ Updated MoonPay integration status to "removed - service denied"
2. ✅ Marked MoonPay integration as removed in TODO list

**File:** `mobile-app/PROGRESS.md`

1. ✅ Marked MoonPay integration task as completed/removed

## What Remains

The following files were kept but marked as deprecated:
- `src/payment_flow_service.py` - Contains MoonPay payment flow logic (deprecated)
- `src/moonpay_service.py` - Contains MoonPay API integration (not modified, effectively unused)

Database fields remain unchanged:
- `PaymentTransaction.moonpay_tx_id` - Will remain null for new transactions
- `PaymentTransaction.payment_method` - Can still store "moonpay" for historical records
- `User.kyc_provider` - Can still store "moonpay" for historical records

## Current Payment Options

After this change, users can only pay with:
1. **USDC Wallet** - Direct payment from connected Solana wallet
2. **Free Questions** - Using earned referral rewards

## Future Considerations

If you want to add fiat payment support in the future, you would need to:
1. Integrate with a different payment provider (e.g., Stripe, Coinbase Commerce, etc.)
2. Update the frontend to add the new payment method
3. Create new backend endpoints for the new provider
4. Update the payment flow service to handle the new provider

## Files Modified

### Website
```
frontend/src/components/PaymentFlow.tsx
apps/backend/main.py
src/payment_flow_service.py
```

### Mobile App
```
mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/billionsbounty/mobile/ui/screens/BountyDetailScreen.kt
mobile-app/app/build.gradle.kts
mobile-app/FINAL_STATUS.md
mobile-app/PROGRESS.md
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test wallet-based USDC payments work correctly
2. Test free question usage works correctly
3. Verify no errors occur when accessing payment flow
4. Confirm error messages appear correctly if users try to use fiat payments
5. Test that old MoonPay API endpoints return 404 errors

## Notes

- The commented-out code in `apps/backend/main.py` can be completely removed in a future cleanup
- The `src/moonpay_service.py` file can be moved to an archive folder or deleted
- Consider removing MoonPay-related database fields in a future database migration
