This directory contains organized scripts for the Billions Bounty project, categorized by their current status and purpose.

## Directory Structure

### `/obsolete/` - Scripts Replaced by Smart Contracts
These scripts are **NO LONGER NEEDED** as their functionality has been fully migrated to smart contracts:

- `initialize_lottery.py` - Lottery initialization (replaced by smart contract)
- `initialize_lottery_correct.py` - Corrected lottery initialization (replaced by smart contract)
- `test_entry_payment.py` - Entry payment testing (replaced by smart contract)

- `test_comprehensive.py` - Comprehensive smart contract testing
- `test_simple.py` - Simple smart contract testing

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** - Use for testing smart contract functionality

### `/utilities/` - Utility Scripts
General utility scripts that are still needed:

- (To be organized)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** - General utilities

### `/smart_contract/` - Smart Contract Management

## Usage

### For Testing Smart Contract:
```bash
cd scripts/testing
python test_comprehensive.py
python test_simple.py
```

### For Smart Contract Management:
```bash
cd scripts/smart_contract
# Use deployment and monitoring scripts
```

## Notes

- All lottery functionality is now handled by the smart contract
- Backend services now focus on AI processing, database management, and user interface
- Fund management is completely autonomous through smart contracts
- No manual fund transfers or lottery management needed
